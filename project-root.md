Tasks are grouped by dependency layer and notes by type.
An entry waits only on the open entries it names under After, so the entries in one layer can run in parallel.

## Tasks (2)

Concrete and claimable; only a task can run.

### Running (1)

Held by a run; its scope is locked until the run ends.
